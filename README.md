# MeasurementPrecision
Measurement Precision toolkit for R

This repository contains source code and a package suitable for R 3.0 and above. It computes a few basic statistics 
and round them accordind to the measurement instrument (deltax).

See Cousineau, D. (submitted) How many decimals? Rounding descriptive statistics based on measurement precision 
for the formal mathematical derivations of the results.
